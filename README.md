# Restaurant Menu App

Welcome to the Restaurant Menu App, a comprehensive solution for managing your restaurant's menu digitally. This application is built with Ruby on Rails and is dockerized for easy development and deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. Visit the official Docker documentation to download and install Docker for your operating system.

## Getting Started

### Setup for Development Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd restaurant_menu_app
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Containers**

   Navigate to the project directory and build the Docker containers using Docker Compose:

   ```sh
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
   ```

3. **Database Setup**

   After building the containers, set up the database with the following commands:

   ```sh
   docker-compose run web rails db:create db:migrate
   ```

4. **Start the Application**

   Start the application by running:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Setup for Production Environment

For production deployment, we use a slightly different Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.prod`), optimized for production:

1. **Build the Docker Image**

   Build the Docker image using the production Dockerfile:

   ```sh
   docker build -t restaurant_menu_app:latest -f Dockerfile.prod .
   ```

2. **Run the Container**

   Run your container by specifying the production environment:

   ```sh
   docker run -d -p 80:80 --name restaurant_menu_app restaurant_menu_app:latest
   ```

   Your application should now be accessible on port 80 of your host machine.
